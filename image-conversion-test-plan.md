# Image Formatting Fix for html-to-pdfmake

## Problem Analysis
User reported that images appear as empty placeholder boxes with borders instead of actual image content. This suggests the images are being detected but not properly rendered in the PDF.

## Root Cause Investigation
1. **CORS Issues**: External images may be blocked by CORS policies
2. **Base64 Format Issues**: Data URLs might not be properly formatted
3. **pdfMake Image Handling**: html-to-pdfmake may not be processing images correctly

## Updated Solution Strategy

### Primary Approach: imagesByReference
- Use html-to-pdfmake's `imagesByReference: true` option
- Let pdfMake handle images directly via its native image loading
- This should work better with external URLs

### Fallback Approach: Enhanced Base64 Conversion  
- Improved CORS handling with proxy fallback
- Better validation of data URL format
- Enhanced canvas processing with proper background

### Implementation Details

#### New Features Added:
1. **Dual Strategy**: Try imagesByReference first, fallback to base64
2. **CORS Proxy**: Use existing image proxy for blocked images  
3. **Enhanced Validation**: Check image dimensions and data URL format
4. **Better Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when images fail
5. **Improved Debugging**: Detailed console logging

## Testing Instructions

1. **Open add-in** at https://localhost:3000
2. **Open browser console** to monitor debug messages
3. **Select "html-to-pdfmake"** engine
4. **Click "Test PDF Engine"** 
5. **Monitor console output** for:
   - "Attempting to use imagesByReference..."
   - "Found X images to process with imagesByReference"
   - Image conversion progress messages

## Expected Console Output

### Success Path (imagesByReference):
```
Attempting to use imagesByReference for better image handling...
Found 3 images to process with imagesByReference
Images found: ["img_ref_0", "img_ref_1", "img_ref_2"]
Creating PDF with images via imagesByReference...
PDF generated successfully with imagesByReference!
```

### Fallback Path (base64):
```
imagesByReference approach failed, falling back to base64 conversion
Converting external images to base64 data URLs...
Found 3 external images to convert
Successfully converted image: https://via.placeholder.com/...
Image conversion completed
```

## Success Criteria

✅ **Images appear correctly** in PDF (not empty boxes)  
✅ **No CORS errors** in browser console  
✅ **Text remains selectable** and properly formatted  
✅ **PDF downloads successfully** without JavaScript errors  

## Troubleshooting

### If images still appear as empty boxes:
1. Check if `imagesByReference` is being triggered in console
2. Verify external image URLs are accessible
3. Test with different image sources (try local images)
4. Check pdfMake version compatibility

### If imagesByReference fails:
1. Monitor base64 conversion fallback in console
2. Verify data URL format starts with `data:image/`
3. Check image proxy functionality
4. Test image loading in browser directly

## Next Steps

If this approach still doesn't work:
1. **Test with local images** to isolate CORS issues
2. **Try different image hosting** services  
3. **Update pdfMake version** if compatibility issues
4. **Consider alternative PDF libraries** if needed
